Bass Model Analysis: Transparent TV Adoption
Project Overview
This project forecasts the adoption of the LG Signature OLED T – Transparent TV using historical flat-screen TV sales as a reference and applying the Bass Diffusion Model. The analysis includes:
Historical sales trends for flat-screen TVs in Germany (2006–2020)
Estimation of Bass model parameters (coefficient of innovation p, coefficient of imitation q, and market potential M)
Forecasting yearly and cumulative adoption for transparent TVs (2025–2039)
Fermi-adjusted adoption predictions to account for realistic market constraints
Visualizations comparing historical flat-screen adoption vs. transparent TV forecast

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd BassModel_TransparentTV
Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
Folder structure
Ensure the data/, img/, report/, and scripts/ folders exist in the project root. The scripts will automatically save plots in the img/ folder and forecasts in the data/ folder.
Usage
Load historical data and plot
python3 scripts/script1.py
This will generate sales_plot.png in img/ showing historical flat-screen TV sales.
Forecast transparent TV adoption
python3 scripts/script2.py
This will:
Fit the Bass model using historical sales
Forecast yearly and cumulative adoption (2025–2039)
Apply Fermi-adjusted adoption
Generate plots: prediction_plot.png, fermi.png, and comparison_plot.png
Print key insights such as peak adoption year and five-year cumulative adoption

Notes
All scripts are compatible with Python 3.x.
Plots are saved automatically in the img/ directory.
The Fermi-adjusted forecast assumes 75% of the potential market will realistically adopt transparent TVs.
